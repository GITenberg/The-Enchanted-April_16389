description: "The Enchanted April is a 1922 novel by British writer Elizabeth von\
  \ Arnim. The work was inspired by a month-long holiday to the Italian Riviera, probably\
  \ the most widely read (as an English and American best seller in 1923) and perhaps\
  \ the lightest and most ebullient of her novels.\nThe novel follows four dissimilar\
  \ women in 1920s England who leave their rainy, grey environments to go on holiday\
  \ in Italy. Mrs Arbuthnot and Mrs Wilkins, who belong to the same ladies' club but\
  \ have never spoken, become acquainted after reading a newspaper advertisement for\
  \ a small medieval castle on the Mediterranean to be let furnished for April. They\
  \ find some common ground in that both are struggling to make the best of unhappy\
  \ marriages. They also reluctantly take on the waspish, elderly Mrs Fisher and the\
  \ stunning but aloof Lady Caroline Dester to defray expenses. The very genuine and\
  \ open Lottie Wilkins, often muddled and awkward in her speech, has been married\
  \ only a few years, but she and her husband are rubbing each other the wrong way;\
  \ as the novel progresses her intuition into her new friends' feelings and needs\
  \ plays a major role. Rose Arbuthnot is highly religious lady who does extensive\
  \ charity work, but is married to an author of racy popular novels who neglects\
  \ her, partly because of her persistent disapproval of his work. Lady Caroline Dester\
  \ is a beautiful socialite who is tired of the burden of London society and is beginning\
  \ to regard her life as shallow and empty, after a man she loved died in WWI. Mrs.\
  \ Fisher is a pompous, snobbish, highly proper lady who knew many Victorian luminaries\
  \ and regards herself as the hostess and in control of the holiday; she prefers\
  \ to live in her memories of times past rather than embracing the present and is\
  \ emotionally closed-off. The four women experience interpersonal tensions but eventually\
  \ come together at the castle and find rejuvenation in the tranquil beauty of their\
  \ surroundings, rediscovering hope and love.\nVon Arnim wrote, and set, the book\
  \ in the 15th-century Castello Brown. Critic Terence de Vere White credited The\
  \ Enchanted April with making the Italian resort of Portofino fashionable.\n From\
